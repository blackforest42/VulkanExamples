How to send framebuffers as textures into other pipelines:

1. When setting up descriptor sets for the stage, the incoming framebuffer is bound by id as a texture:

      std::vector<VkWriteDescriptorSet> writeDescriptorSets = {

          vks::initializers::writeDescriptorSet(
              descriptorSets_[i].blurVert,
              VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER, /*bind id*/ 1,
              &offscreenPass_.framebuffers[0].descriptor),
      };

In this case it is `offscreenPass_.framebuffers[0].framebuffer`

2. During rendering (command buffering), the blackhole drawing stage must set the same framebuffer as a destination:

      renderPassBeginInfo.framebuffer = offscreenPass_.framebuffers[0].framebuffer;


Skip mipmapping for now. Down/up sample at level=0 (source image) for now.
